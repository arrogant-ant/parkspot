                      People usually search on Google Maps to reach a particular\
                      location but sometimes it happens that people don’t get\
                      the exact address from the map.It is easy to find places\
                      like malls, hospitals, and much more popular sites, but \
                      when it comes to finding a specific location like a house, \
                      it’s really hard.<br> <br> ParkSpot helps in this situation. \
                      ParkSpot stores the exact location of the parking location \
                      and gives a navigation feature that will direct the ParkSpot \
                      user to navigate to the desired parking space.This easy-finding \
                      feature helps let users experience a hassle-free parking experience.`,

                      vehicle might get towed away. Just like people going to Movie \
                      Theatres after booking a ticket so that they don’t need to worry \
                      about the availability of tickets after going to the Theatre, users \
                      can also book their car parking space by using our platform and \
                      will be assured that there will be a parking space reserved for \

                      provides short term booking as well as long term rental booking. \
                      So if people want to go out of the station for a few days and people \
                      who do not have a parking area in their apartment and do not have \
                      a parking spot to keep their vehicle, they may not be able to \
                      afford airport parking rates and malls do not allow longtime booking. \
                      ParkSpot can be of help in this situation. ParkSpot helps users to book \
                      the best, cheap and secure parking space for the long term at a very reasonable price.`,
