            In the recent years all over the globe production and demand for
            motor vehicles has increased dramatically. Earlier motor vehicles
            were a luxury only few can afford but now their prices have
            plummeted and its more easily available to the population. India for
            an example took about 60 years to acquire 100 million vehicles and
            the next 100 million vehicles were bought in the last 10 years !

            This sheer increase in vehicles has caused a strain on the roadways
            and parking infrastructure. Having such a high population and
            vehicle density in India only makes things worse. These problems
            elevate the risk of traffic jams in urban cities. With Bengaluru
            facing the worst traffic congestion in the world, Delhi, Mumbai and
            Pune remain in the top 10 source traffic congestion index.

            What causes a traffic jam ?
        </h3>
        <p>
            There a numerous reasons for traffic jams like lack of proper
            infrastructure, office rush hours, illegal parkings and many more.
            Improper parkings beside roads/no parking zones are he main cause
            for traffic jams. Even the widest of roads have traffic jams because
            of illegal parkings. Widening the ones which face traffic jams are
            not so rewarding because empty roads means more room for people to
            park vehicles. Inadequate parking infrastructure is the reason to
            blame when people park their vehicles in no parking zones. Absence
            of a proper inventory for parking sites and the lack of awareness is
            the root of the cause.
