            Understanding the Causes:
        </h3>
        <p>
            Before delving into the solutions, it's crucial to understand the root causes of the car parking 
            dilemma in urban areas. Rapid urbanization, coupled with a surge in the number of vehicles on the road, 
            has significantly strained existing parking infrastructure. Moreover, inadequate urban planning and 
            zoning regulations often fail to address the growing parking needs of residents and commuters. 
            The result? Overcrowded streets, congested parking lots, and frustrated drivers.
