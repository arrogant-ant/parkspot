            Parking problems have always been an issue and this issue has grown
            exponentially with the increase of population. In order to tackle
            this issue, many solutions were tried and implemented. For example,
            commercial parkings were built where vehicle owners can pay and park
            their vehicles at hourly rates. With the increase of vehicles in an
            area, the demand for off-street parking also increased vigorously.
            Government made special rules like for every 1000 square feet of an
            area, there must be some particular number of parking spaces in that
            area.

            In a recent survey, it is calculated that in a city of India,<mark
                >Bengaluru has only 13000 parking spaces for cars and 40000 for
                two-wheelers but Bengaluru has registered over 75 lakhs
                vehicles.</mark
            >Mostly the parking spaces are located in malls, hospitals,
            stadiums, etc which are mostly vacant as they are private parking
            and are allowed for only hourly parking and people usually don’t go
            to these places. It is calculated that on an average a vehicle owner
            needs three parking spaces for his/her vehicle. First at home,
            second at his workplace and the third if the user goes out
            somewhere. Now, a question arises, where would a person park his
            vehicle who usually does not go to these places. Mostly the<strong

                their vehicle, at roadside, or wherever they find space where
                their vehicle can fit. Illegal parking results in vehicle tow,
                theft, damages, traffic congestions, etc.</strong

            It is assumed that people having their own house will have parking
            space. This is not exactly true. Two out of ten do not have parking
            space for their vehicles. This is because there are many apartments
            where parking spaces are not provided. After their home, people go
            to work and hence they would require a parking space for their
            vehicle but mostly the number of vehicles exceeds the space
            available at the office premises. So, employees have to come early
            in order to get a spot. Other than home and office, people go out to
            malls, markets, and many other places. Yes, malls could have parking
            spaces, but there are places like local market shops where people
            usually go but there are not proper parking spaces.

            The parking issue is like something that can’t be completely
            resolved. We, ParkSpot, are trying to solve some of the parking
            issues to some extent by creating a smart parking system. Smart
            parking system does not mean that vehicles will automatically search
            a parking spot and drive by itself to the spot. Smart Parking System
            means that people can use a platform where people can search nearby
            parking spaces and check the availability and can even book a spot
            online in a few clicks , just like people buy movie tickets. People
            usually illegally park their vehicle because they don’t know where
            they can find a parking space that can let the person park his car
            to whatever duration the person wants to park. To resolve this
            issue, we have placed a search and booking option in our platform.
            As we went deeper into the issues, we found that there are a
            considerable amount of people who are desperately looking for
            parking space on a monthly basis. It means people own vehicles but
            don’t have their own parking space. As we went deeper to resolve
            this issue, we found that people are not getting parking spaces
            because there is a demand supply gap. People who have parking space
            but don’t have their vehicle can rent their parking space too just
            like people rent their flats, houses, etc. People are unaware that
            this can be a source of income where people don’t have to do any
            physical work.

            As soon as the people get aware that they can rent their parking,
            the parking issue where people need it on a monthly basis can be
            resolved to some extent. Another solution could be the parking space
            of the malls, stadiums, etc. These spaces are mostly vacant, and can
            be used on non-busy days. This can profit both the parties, parking
            owners and the vehicle owners. Yes, it's true that these
            pre-existing parking spots can not handle the upcoming demands of
            the parking. Awareness is missing because we are mis-calculating the
            parking issue. The issues are bigger than what we have thought of
            it.<strong
