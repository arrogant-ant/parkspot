            <span class="first-letter">P</span>arking has been a major concern
            in major cities. Due to fewer parking spaces, people have to spend a
            lot of time searching for the right spot. Another concern is the
            parking charges. Especially when it comes to Bangalore downtown, the
            charges are so high that it’s getting difficult day by day to afford
            to park there. In spite of these issues, the majority of people
            prefer driving to the workplace than using public transport. They
            feel it is much more convenient. They do not have to depend on the
            specific timings of public transport and can leave whenever they
            want to. Also, many of them have additional duties such as picking/
            dropping their kids to school while coming to the office. So, having
            their own car helps in multitasking.

            <li>
                No Parking option provided by offices, especially in downtowns.
            </li>
            <li>Lack of spots for the clients and customers.</li>
            <li>Rule Violations.</li>

                <span class="custom-bold-text">Stacked Spaces:</span> Parking
                cars one after the other in form of stacks. This would work if
                the one who has parked the car inside would leave later. But
                this can not be the case always. So, figuring out a method
                through which only those cars that leave later get parked inside
                can somehow help solve the parking issue and a lot more cars
                will get parked this way. This can be done through valley
                parking.

                <span class="custom-bold-text">Transportation Allowance:</span>
                The company can help its employees by providing an allowance for
                public transport or uber. This will help in encouraging them to
                use public transport and avoid coming by personal car.

                Getting to know personal insights and feedback is very
                important. Speak to your employees on this, what challenges do
                they face, what solutions would help them in this situation.
